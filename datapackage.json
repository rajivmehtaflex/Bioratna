  "description": "In the development of new potential drugs the risk estimate of health hazards is a main challenge. To face this challenge, the careful and extensive investigation of known toxins is the basis to assess the properties of unknown substances. \r\nIn order to achieve this aim, we have collected toxic compounds from literature and web sources in the database SuperToxic. \r\n\r\nThe current version of this database compiles approx. 60,000 compounds with about 100,000 synonyms. These molecules are classified according to their toxicity based on more than 2,500,000 measurements.\r\n\r\nSchmidt, U. ; Struck, S. et al. SuperToxic: a comprehensive database of toxic compounds.\r\nNucleic Acids Research 2008, doi:10.1093/nar/gkn850 ",
